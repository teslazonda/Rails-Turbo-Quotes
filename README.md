This application showcases the basic functionality of Rails Turbo, which allows developers to easily make single page applications without writing any custom AJAX requests.

The application features seamless creation, updates, and deletion of quotes without reloading the page, and real-time streaming of data with the help of Action Cable. This means all quotes are available to users of the same company all at the same time, updated constantly.

Users that are not of the same company will not be granted access to the data streams of other companies.

To use, install Ruby and Rails and clone the repository.
